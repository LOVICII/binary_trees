# AVL_trees
binary_tree.py contains an implementaiton of a binary tree, at the bottom of the file are some functions that need implementing to turn the binary tree into an AVL_tree
testing.py is what I've been using to run the code and it displays the trees.

I've based the binary tree implementation on this one: https://github.com/laurentluce/python-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/binary_tree.py
I've extended it to AVL trees using: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/
